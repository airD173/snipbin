# snip-bin

A blazing fast, lightweight, open-source and elegant alternative to PasteBin.

# About

I'm tired of using PasteBin for sharing code, it's absolutely littered with ads, bad UI, and don't even mention the light theme... introducing, SnipBin! SnipBin is a very lightweight and open source code pasting website which does make you want to gouge your eyes out with a grapefruit for when you look at it (take notes, [PasteBin]) and combines simplicity and elegance.
