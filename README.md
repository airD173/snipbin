# SnipBin

We all have those times where we need to share code. Whether our
text exceeds Discord's 2,000 character limit or to share a snippet
of code with my friends so they can copy my programming homework,
sharing code is a rather crucial thing in the lives of most programmers.

My main motivation behind creating this website is the fact that
there are no good, simple and feature-rich paste websites out there,
and I envision SnipBin to fill in all visible gaps and shortcomings
of other code-sharing websites.

# Philosophy

As mentioned above, while I was creating SnipBin, I had noticed some
major and annoying shortcomings of most other paste websites, and SnipBin
is my attempt to create the closest-to-perfect paste websites for my
personal standards.

### Ad-free

Anybody who's shared code before has most probably heard of this website
called [PasteBin](https://pastebin.com/), which is an extremely feature rich
and handy website however it's absolutely LITTERED with ads everywhere. I'm
a highschool student doing this stuff for fun, I don't really have an much
of an intention to monetise this project.

### Simple, nevertheless beautiful

Being a web designer, I can assure that you don't need a 13 megabyte package
to add these animations which give people epilepsy attacks. This website
is set in the beautiful FiraCode Mono font, along with a relaxed and chill
colour scheme that is relaxing to the eyes. Taking the example of PasteBin,
the grotesque layout on the website combined with the atrocious colours
instantly makes it a no-go for me.

### Powerful API

Nobody likes to work with a poorly documented API. Now, in all honesty,
I don't think that my API documentation is really good or anything, but
it's understandable and clear which is a large step up from sites like
PasteBin.

You can view the API documentation at `https://snip.hxrsh.in/api-docs.md/`

### Powerful

Many might bring up that this website has a lot of parallels with another
code sharing website, known has [Hastebin](https://hastebin.com/). This is
true, however, I believe that Hastebin lacks a lot of essetial features
for code sharing websites. For example, I cannot keep track of all my
different pastes within Hastebin and they delete the paste 7 days after
creation. Although Hastebin looks a bit better than Pastebin, stuff like
this makes Hastebin feel just as bad. SnipBin, on the other hand, features
powerful features such as custom slugs, snip passwords, and OPTIONAL
authentication features allowing users to keep track of their snips.

### Accessible

I am one of those people who are so lazy that they don't want to switch
between their mouse and keyboard. Therefore, I designed this website to
be accessible from only the keyboard. With that to say, the website
does take into account people with touchscreens and adds buttons for them
accordingly. It also comes with built-in keyboard shortcuts for basic
commands and utility, speeding up user interactions within the site.

# Privacy

I don't care about what you, or any other user of this website posts. I
won't be deleting any user accounts unless explicitly asked for, or
selling your data to Microsoft or any other company. Snips are not
deleted unless the government or someone who can get me into trouble tells
me to delete them. Be aware that anybody can view the content you snip
on this website. Please use the "encrypt snip" feature to add a password
to your snips if you wouldn't like anybody else to view them.

# Open source

SnipBin is open sourced on [GitHub](https://github.com/harshhhdev/snipin),
feel free to give it a star if you use the project. It makes me feel that
at least someone is using these websites I make while I procrastinate
from my homework.
